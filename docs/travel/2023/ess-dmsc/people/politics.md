A space for thoughts about software/systems roadmaps, organizational policies and paths forward, and the like.

### Random Notes

I took the notes below on the first day. Just pasting them in.

#### Data

- All the facilities in Europe have come together to produce a very similar set of data policies for how they handle data/metadata.
- When the ESS schedules a proposal a DOI is minted and assigned to the proposed work.
- They will produce data management plans that go over all of the details of your experiment (software used, workflows/pipelines, file formats, etc)
- They are standardizing across HDF5 with NeXus.
- SciCat has support for Google (I have no idea what I meant here)... google auth?
- <https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en>
- They are planning on storing the geometry of the instrument in the HDF5/Nexus.
- <https://dashboard.wholetale.org/>

#### Proposals

- They are using ORCID
- Who is coming to ESS (types of proposals)?
  - Peer Reviewed
  - Quick
  - Discretionary
  - Proprietary
  - Alternative Access
- Ask for their slides
- “The User Journey” is great.
- They are collaborating with ISIS and CLF
- The list of Proposal do’s and don’ts is great. Should pass it by Valerie

### Questions

- PaNOSC & Horizon 2020
  - What’s Horizon?
    - Is it behind the standardization in data policy that you mention?
  - Who all is involved in PaNOSC?
- Are you aware of DMPTool?
- You mentioned that most facilities have data catalogues. You are using SciCat. Do you know what other catalogs are used in that space?
- What do you know about <https://wholetale.org/> ?
