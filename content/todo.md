# Hasty thoughts to ensure I don't lose

Not sure what will go here yet. At least one note though.

sorta a CRO (Contract Research Organization)

- Thoughts
  - Not Lisa
    - I feel like I had something to mention to David from the hotel?....
    - Think about the important bits that I relayed to Connie and crew.
      - Ensure that I communicate the fact that the important bits have been communicated to them
      - Shea, Don B, etc.
    - Ask Fredrik for help with the social side of things.
      - May get sticky if we are going to unify the country.
      - He could likely help.
    - Check out Naperville, and Willow.... spring? brook? downs? Willow something.
