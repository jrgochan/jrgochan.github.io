Hej There!

## Main Framework
- https://github.com/easyScience

### EasyCore
- https://github.com/easyScience/easyCore

### Statements
- Some folks said Easy* was easier than SciPy
  - EasyBragg
  - EasyQENS
  - EasyCore documentation needs some love.
- easyScience wants to make use of dask.
- easyScience does not use dask. it is capable. 
- scipp and dask are exclusive.
- scipp would need to make use of dask to integrate with easyScience
- It is a four person team
- easyDiffraction uses easyCrystalography
- everyone has written a package for the maths
  - easyDiffraction points to whichever engine you'd like.
  - It currently can point to the fortran library that GSAS uses.
  - had not heard of MAUD, but doesn't do that kind of science.

### Thoughts
- Would it be possible to record these presentations and post them online?
