      - Written by a company called Global Phasing
    - How it could be improved
      - Pipeline could be improved to support HDF5
      - AutoPROC allows for HDF and CBF (Crystallographic Binary Format)
      - It could also be improved to work on clustered computing.
    - Diamond
      - They have an auto-processing pipeline
      - GridEngine they might be using?
      - Lewis is interested in aligning with their operations?
  - He is a fan of

- Thoughts

#### 12:00 PM - Lunch with IMCA-CAT team at Shikara (Indian cuisine)

#### 1:30 PM - Meet with Erica Duguid (structural biologist)

##### Erica
- Statements
  - WHen accounts are created in synchweb.
    - "mx, sw, in" groups are made.
    - mx - macromolecular crystallography
    - sw - service work (this is the one that is mostly used)
    - in - industry
  - Once they have a proposal, they are scheduled a 'visit' in synchweb, which makes a no sense.
  - "Ask for a list of all of the things that the companies still want out of synchweb, regardless of where it comes from"
  - "What's important for us right now is that a company will make a shipment."
    - Lab contact is important
    - They arrange their data by site, esp if visits aren't seperate.
    - "The container identifier is not standardized amoung the MX community."
    - Pucks have names.
      - There is only one place that makes Pucks, and they promised to not duplicate names. There are QR codes on them.
      - They have a laser engraver.
      - They have been printing QR barcodes for the pucks and have been labeling them with the name of the Puck from the manufacturer.
    - ISPyB is pretty much the backend for most light sources.
    - SLS (the swiss light source) did not use ISPyB
  - Each proposal has a list of 
    - Registered Containers
    - Registered Dewars (not in use at IMCA)
  - Puck naming. Must be fixed
    - Abbvie (Spinoff of Abbott labs)
    - Bristol Meyers Squibb
    - Evotech
    - Johnson & Johnson
    - Merck
    - Novartis
    - Pfizer
    - Relay
  - Shipment label that the company puts on a dewar, MUST CONTAIN INFO! FIX INTERFACE.
  - Synchweb 'requires' 'Protein Acronym'. This should perhaps go away.
  - "To be compliant with APS requirements, they must give us some info about the contents of their samples."
  - Samples are sorted in the filesystem by
    - Company (AccountName), Site, Visit Number, Date, Puck Name, Position in Puck
