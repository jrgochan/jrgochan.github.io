SoftWhere? Searching for Research Software in the UK.

#### Paper 2

*Summary*
Submissions of source code for research projects from higher education institutions in the UK has fallen dramatically; this abstract provides a clear problem statement,corresponding statistics, and a discussion of impacts and recommendations.

*Strengths*
Bravo

*Weaknesses*
Jumping between integer values, then percentages, then integers is a bit wonky. Why not just give the amount of URLs that 'worked'? Or not specify the concept in two very similar ways.

*Recommendation*
Accept. Would love to read more.
