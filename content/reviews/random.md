Does this make sense?

#### Guidance


So let's say it was a paper on how to clips a cat's nails for a workshop on animal care.

*Summary*: This abstract gives an overview of clipping and maintaining a cat's claws.
*Strengths*: Everyone cares about this topic because cat claws hurt. They did a good job of describing the tools needed.
*Weaknesses*: There is research out there that suggests cat's might scratch you. This paper doesn't provide any information on how to avoid scratches.
*Recommendation*: Weak accept; it's a valuable topic but it really does need the scratch mitigation plan to be truly complete

#### Paper 1

*Summary*
CI/CD, using GitHub Actions that gives a brief overview of the software testing methodologies used in three different scientific software packages.

*Strengths*
Testing types, triggering events, and corresponding GitHub Action steps are summarized and displayed in a readable manner.

*Weaknesses*
I noted several spelling and grammar errors.

*Recommendation*
While an overview is given of the types and quality of testing is given about three different kinds of scientific software packages, it well... could be a lot better.
- Fix
  - Spelling and grammar
  - Fix various non-sequiters.
Seeing as the projects vary significantly is approach, and scope, some discussion of the relative merits of each project's testing implementation would be useful.

##### Pro
- Useful to know that GitHub Actions is the most widely used CI/CD now.
- Good to know that only 4.66% of GHA are testing related. This should be higher.
##### Con
- Seems to be written by early career?
- Hard to understand
  - "Chen et al. [3] conducted an empirical study to investigate the adoption of GitHub Actions and how it impacts the project properties. According to their results, 22% of the projects in their dataset adopted GitHub Actions and on average these projects had 2.8 configured workflows per project. The authors discuss how developers must set several components with lots of alternatives when configuring GitHub Actions and how this could become challenging to develop suitable GitHub Actions for a given project. We think this is especially true for scientific software as these are often written by scientists themselves [4]."
- Descriptions of software packages are kind of... a mess... But they mostly cover what each package is.
##### Type
- RQ4
  - 'filed'
