### Info Header
A Landing Page of Things and stuff.

### Day 2 - ESS McStas
Started the day with an example of what monte carlo can be used for to approximate Pi, and then do ray tracing for a detector.

- Interested Parties
  - AOT, for sure, should be looking into McStas

#### Questions / Important / Thoughts
- Thoughts
  - Why aren't we collaborating more closely?
- Questions
  - What does the collaboration look like with ORNL?
  - For this "Universal thing"
    - What if instruments/components in McStas hand unique Persistent IDs?
      - That would allow the gemoetry, so on and so forth, to propegate out.
  - JupyterHub
    - What kind of GPUs/hardware are you using?
    - What container orchestration is the Jupyter hub running in?
    - What software is handling the configuration management and infrastructure-as-code


#### Useful Bits
- JupyterLab
  - `Shift+Tab` gives you docs about the thing you're focused on.


#### McStas Conversation w/ Peter Willendrup
- McStas
  - Monte Carlo Simulation of triple axis spectrometers
  - Should be McStaf
- Clinton Pile at Oak Ridge (one of the first production research reactors)
  - Someone had the idea that we could cut some holes in the side and there we go. World's first Neutron source.
  - Nobel Prize for Neutron Scattering to these guys: Clifford Shull, Bertrand Brockhouse
